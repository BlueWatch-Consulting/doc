Sets up very quickly a test environment with a local web server, which seems to be adressable only locally.

Therefore, set up a reverse proxy:

File /etc/httpd/conf.d/drupal-qd.conf
  <Location /qd>
    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8888
    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8888
  </Location>

Installing a new environment:

  # set up
  cd /tmp
  drush -y qd
  # abort server
  
  cd /tmp/quick-drupal-{timestamp}/drupal
  vi sites/default/settings.php
  
    $base_url = 'http://nbt1/qd'
    $conf['reverse_proxy'] = TRUE;
    $conf['reverse_proxy_addresses'] = array('127.0.0.1');

Starting up:

  cd /tmp/quick-drupal-{timestamp}/drupal
  drush rs

'''Doesn't work anyway - form buttons are not prefixed with the path from $base_url.'''
