Sets up very quickly a test environment with a web server.

Directory for install: <tt>/tmp/drupal_qd/drupal</tt>. SQLite database <tt>/tmp/drupal_qd/drupal.sqlite</tt>

Install with projects (enables modules with the same name):

  drush -y qd drupal  \
    uuid entity deploy features  \
    --root=/tmp/drupal_qd/drupal  \
    --no-server  \
    --account-pass=secret

(The <tt>--enable</tt> parameter is not used because seems to prevent execution of dependency checking.)

Run server on an IP acessible from outside (without starting a browser locally):

  drush --root=/tmp/drupal_qd/drupal rs 192.168.56.12:8888  -
