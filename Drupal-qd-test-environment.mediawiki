Sets up very quickly a test environment with a local web server, which seems to be adressable only locally.

Therefore, set up a reverse proxy:

File /etc/httpd/conf.d/drupal-qd.conf
  <Location /qd>
    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8888
    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8888
  </Location>

Installing a new environment:

  # set up
  cd /tmp
  drush -y qd
  # abort server
  
  cd /tmp/quick-drupal-{timestamp}/drupal
  # set $base_url to mapped proxy path (e.g., http://nbt1/qd)
  vi sites/default/settings.php
  
Starting up:

  cd /tmp/quick-drupal-{timestamp}/drupal
  drush rs
