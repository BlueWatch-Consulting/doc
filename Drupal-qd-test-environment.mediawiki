Sets up very quickly a test environment with a web server.

Directory for install: <tt>/tmp/dummy</tt>. SQLite database <tt>/tmp/dummy.sqlite</tt>

Install with projects (enables modules with the same name):

  drush -y qd dummy  \
    uuid entity deploy features  \
    --root=/tmp/dummy  \
    --no-server  \
    --account-pass=secret

(The <tt>--enable=</tt> parameter is not used because seems to prevent execution of dependency checking.)

Run server on an IP acessible from outside (without starting a browser locally):

  drush --root=/tmp/dummy rs 192.168.56.12:8888  -
